## Instructions

## Product List

The app displays a list of products these fields:
* a vote count
* the name of the product
* the year that the product became available
* who produced that product
* the user who submitted that product
* The product title should provide a link to a web page containing more detail on that product. This should be an external page (e.g. an amazon.ca product page).
* Users should be able to vote to increase the vote count of a product.
* Products should be listed vertically from the greatest number of votes at the top, to the least number of votes at the bottom. This ordering should update in real time as the vote count changes.
* The "submitted by" user list is static. There is no need to add new users. Provide at least 3 users in the list.
* The "submitted by" user should be represented by an avatar image.

## Input form

* Add the ability to add a new item to the list by filling and submitting a form.
* All fields are required except image URL.
* Empty fields should prevent the form from submitting.
* New items start with a vote count of one (1)
* Product images should work if a valid image URL is provided in the form submission. If no image URL is provided, a placeholder image should take it's place
